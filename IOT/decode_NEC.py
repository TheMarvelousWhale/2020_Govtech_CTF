    """
    We read in salae data, then convert command field it into ascii
    NEC IR relies on the space between pulses to encode the bit
    They send data using burst of 562.5Âµs, followed by x ms space, which is extremely helpful for decoding
    There are 4 type of space
    1. 18.37microsec - this is for one pulse within the burst 
    2. 562 microsec - this is for bit 0
    3. 1.6875milisec - this is for bit 1
    4. 4.5 milisec - this is for the leading command

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : TYPE  data from salae 1.2.18, which has time stamp of each transition 
        DESCRIPTION.

    Returns
    -------
    None.
