### IOT Challenge 1 - CoVid's Communication

__Problem given:__ We have been given a .logicdata form and are tasked to get the flag

Using salae's Logic 1.2.8, we visualize the capture data. Looking at the data's signature 9ms pulse burst followed by 4.5ms of space, we conclude that this is NEC IR protocol ( - also in line with the hint "light" ). Following which, the first 8bit are the address and 8bit address inverse, then 8 bit command and 8bit command inverse (with a final 562 microseconds burst). 

Checking the address, 0x00 and 0x11 (the inverse), this part is valid
Cheking the command, we found that the 8-bit of the inverse portion wasn't the inverse of the command portion's 8 bit. Decoding as ascii, the bit gives 'g'. 

This gives us a hint that the 16 bit command portion has been misused for covert communication. Decoding the first 4 packet yields "govt", affirming that we are on the right track. 

Final flag is govtech-csg{InfraRed_2020_CTF!@}
